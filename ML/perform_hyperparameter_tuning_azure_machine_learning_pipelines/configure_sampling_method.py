#main sampling methods:
#Grid sampling: Tries every possible combination.
#Random sampling: Randomly chooses values from the search space.
#Sobol: Adds a seed to random sampling to make the results reproducible.
#Bayesian sampling: Chooses new values based on previous results.

#chooses hyperparameter values based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm
#tries to select parameter combinations that will result in improved performance from the previous selection
